    <h2>Flat Earth Conspiracy</h2>
    <h3>Belief in the Flat Earth</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Authority cannot be trusted - NASA, government</li>
      <li>Any information could be fraudulent</li>
      <li>Movement seems to operate on a flat plane</li>
      <li>Info typically gathered from Youtube</li>
      <li>A picture of Chicago, taken from Lake Michigan, in which the city’s skyscrapers are clearly visible despite being viewed from a distance of 100 km out. “Given the curvature of the Earth, you shouldn’t [in principle] be able to see the skyline of the city from that far out,” [McIntyre] says.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Beliefs in the Spherical Earth</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Aristotle went to Egypt and noticed different stars</li>
      <li>Pictures of Earth have been taken from Space</li>
      <li>In any direction, one can traverse the land, and they will eventually end up where they began. Movement is possible in every direction, from every place. Ex. Russia to Alaska, North Pole to South Pole, Africa to South America</li>
      <li>Léon Foucault, who in 1851 famously hung a heavy 28 kg brass bob from a 67 m chain in the Panthéon in Paris. Such a pendulum, which can swing in any plane, changes direction during the course of a day, yielding direct evidence of the Earth’s rotation.</li>
      <li>Coriolis force, which acts perpendicular to the direction of motion of a spinning mass. This force leads to cyclones swirling clockwise in the southern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere; through the direction of winds, it also impacts ocean currents.</li>
      <li>Response to Chicago’s photo.</li>
      <li>Conspiracy is inconsistent - no working map</li>
