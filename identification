    <h2>Check the source</h2>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <li>Edu, com, org, gov</li>
      <li>Who funds it? How do they benefit?</li>
      <li>How do they know? What tests did they conduct?</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>See who else is reporting the story.</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Find additional sources to get many POVs</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Examine the evidence.</h2>

      <li>Is the test credible?</li>
      </li>Could the information be misinterpreted?</li>
      <li>Is there enough evidence?</li>
    <h2>Don't take images at face value.</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Be aware of photoshop and computer software that could edit what you think you see. Just because you see it does not mean it is real.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Check that it sounds right.</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Use logic</li>
      <li>Is the answer plausible? Does it align with previous knowledge?</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Check biases<h2>
    <h2>Consult an expert</h2>
    <h2>Check the date it was posted</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The older something is, the more incorrect it could be, especially with current events.</li>
