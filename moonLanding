    <h2>Moon Landing Conspiracy</h2>
    <h3>Belief of Conspiracy: Landing was Fake</h3>
    <h3>Counterarguments</h3>
    <h4>Camera</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Studio recording is usually done in 25 or 30 fps. The landing is in 10 fps</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Slow Motion</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Taping could only have worked with electronic storage or film.</li>
      <li>Slow motion footage (~⅓ speed) of 143 minutes long would be around 47 live minutes of footage. Storage disks could only hold 30 seconds at the time. If NASA had secret advanced disks, it’s unlikely that they would be ~3000x better.</li>
      <li>The film tape length would be over 6000 feet long and would likely have some imperfections of dust or hair. These are not seen.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Lighting</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>The shadows casted are almost perfectly parallel to the figures which is not possible with a close spotlight. A spotlight would cause the shadows to diverge further. There is no way to recreate it in a closed environment, it requires great distance.</li>
      <li>Any photos showing non-parallel shadows can be explained with the positioning of the moon and the sun, the elevation compared to the shadow, and the reflection of light from the moon’s surface.</li>
    </ol>
